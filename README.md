This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or

# 📚 Course: **Mastering Next.js (2025 Edition)**  
**Goal**: Become a full-stack developer using modern Next.js with React, Tailwind, TypeScript, API routes, Server Components, and deployment.

---

## 📦 Module 1: Introduction & Setup
- What is Next.js? Why use it in 2025?
- SSR vs CSR vs SSG vs ISR 🔄
- Folder structure of App Router (`app/`, not `pages/`)
- Installing Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- Using VS Code extensions + formatting tools

---

## 🧩 Module 2: Routing System (App Router)
- File-based routing
- Nested layouts & `layout.tsx`
- `page.tsx` vs `layout.tsx` vs `template.tsx`
- Dynamic routes (`[slug]`)
- Catch-all routes (`[[...slug]]`)
- Route groups (`(auth)/login`)

---

## 🔥 Module 3: Components & Rendering
- Server Components (default) vs Client Components
- Using `"use client"` and React hooks
- Shared layout between pages
- Partial rendering and streaming
- Component reuse & best practices

---

## 🧠 Module 4: React Fundamentals (Next-Optimized)
- `useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`, `useContext`
- `useRouter`, `useParams`, `useSearchParams`
- Controlled vs uncontrolled forms
- Lifting state up + prop drilling vs context

---

## 🌐 Module 5: Data Fetching & APIs
- `fetch()` in Server Components
- Calling external/public APIs
- `app/api/route.ts` — API route handlers (GET, POST, etc.)
- Connecting with a database (Prisma + MySQL/Postgres)
- Mutations with `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`
- Edge functions vs Serverless

---

## 🔐 Module 6: Authentication & Authorization
- Client-side auth with cookies/session
- Server-side auth (middleware, guards)
- Integrating `next-auth` or custom JWT auth

---

## 💬 Module 8: Forms & Validation
- Controlled forms with `useState`
- React Hook Form
- Client-side validation with `zod`
- Server-side validation with `zod` or custom checks
- File uploads (client + backend)

---

## 🗃️ Module 9: Database Integration
- Setup Prisma with MySQL/PostgreSQL
- Defining models: Users, Appointments, Posts
- `prisma.schema` and migration
- API integration with DB (read/write/update/delete)
- Relational data + nested queries

---

## ⚙️ Module 10: Advanced Features
- Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)
- Metadata API (`generateMetadata`)
- Middleware (`middleware.ts`)
- Edge functions (geo-based routing, rate-limiting)
- Environment variables (.env.local)
- Revalidation and cache control

---

## 🧪 Module 11: Testing & Debugging
- Unit testing with Jest
- Component testing with React Testing Library
- API testing with Postman or Thunder Client
- Debugging tools in Next.js
- Logging and error handling

---

## 🚀 Module 12: Deployment & Optimization
- Building for production
- Vercel deployment (CI/CD)
- Image optimization with `next/image`

---

## 🏁 Final Project
> A **Hospital Appointment Booking System** using:
- Next.js frontend (React + Tailwind)

If you want, I can turn this into a **Notion page**, **PDF**, or break each module into daily/weekly tasks. Want that?
